Here's a quick guide for contributing:

1. Fork the repo.

1. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great
to know that you have a clean slate: `npm test`

1. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need
a test!

1. Make the test pass.

1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

## Syntax

* Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.
